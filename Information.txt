Information I need:
- what the buffer is going to look like
- 

What I need to do:
UDP for regular, continuous updates (Video frames) and TCP for large, infrequent, vital updates

2 ports will be occupied
one for UDP and 1 for TCP
and you need to be able to send/recieve on both
for each, have a send buffer and a recieve buffer
and functions to add things to the send buffer and retrieve stuff from the recieve buffer

whenever you empty the send buffer, have a timestamp for both when it was sent and when it was added to the buffer

and for recieving when it was recieved and when it was emptied from the buffer

Questions:
When you add data to a stack, is it the actual object or a copy of the object

Further Notes:
- when send() and addToSendBuffer() are supposed to be used
- possibly issue a warning when too many items are in the buffer
- remember to update IC functions
- remember to close the socket
